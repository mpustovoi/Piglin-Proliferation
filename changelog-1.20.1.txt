- Piglin Traveler
    - A new piglin variant who can be found in camps or just wandering around the nether
    - Traveler Camps
        - A common new structure where the Piglin Traveler can be found, consisting of a Fire Ring and a slab for sitting down
        - Spawns in all nether biomes except for basalt deltas (due to jankiness)
        - Generates as a 'camp gathering' in the Crimson Forest instead, with 3 Piglin Travelers and a 'fallen log'
    - Barter with the Traveler to get items that help you explore the nether, including their very own compass! 
    - Traveler's Compass
        - Points to a random biome or structure in the nether
        - Shows its coordinates in the item description
        - Can be duplicated by combining it with a normal compass in the crafting table
        - NOTE: Travelers can't give you a duplicate compass for 20 minutes after you first got it; you'll always get new locations if you do all your bartering within that timeframe 
    - Has a head block just like the other piglin variants
- Fire Rings
    - A cheaper variant of the campfire that takes twice as long to cook items and gives off half as much light
    - Using a potion (splash or lingering too) on a Fire Ring applies all of the potion's effects to surrounding areas for as long as its duration (e.g. 8 minute Potion of Swiftness will last on a Fire Ring for 8 minutes)
    - Potions can be added with a Dispenser
    - Soul Fire Rings have half the range but double the temporary effect time (i.e. an entity leaving the range of a Soul Fire Ring will keep its effects for 20 seconds afterwards instead of 10)
    - Comes in Stone, Deepslate, Blackstone, Netherrack and Endstone variants
    - Crafted with 3 of a valid stone type and a piece of coal
    - NOTE: Stone and Deepslate Fire Rings are crafted with their cobbled stone variants
- Buckler changes
    - Doubled durability to 128
    - Improved description
        - Reworded to increase clarity
        - In order to show the full description, you now have to hold down the sneak key while hovering over a Buckler
    - Enchantment buffs
        - Turning now has 5 levels; each level increases your turning speed but reduces the attack damage from hitting an entity with a Buckler
        - Turning V gives you full turn control like before, but now 1-2 bash damage as well
        - Bang decreases your durability much less than before (2-6 depending on bang level rather than 5-15)
- Redesigned Piglin Alchemist loot table to be more related to brewing and alchemy
- Zombified Piglins can now use any ranged weapons they're holding to attack you... even more reason not to anger them!
- Added new language translations
    - French
    - German
    - Spanish
    - British English (just changes Traveler to Traveller)
    - NOTE: Translation help is wanted, please contact us if you're willing!! In particular, Spanish needs proofreading as we couldn't verify it with a native speaker, and Russian, Ukrainian and Vietnamese are very incomplete
- Bugfixes
    - Piglin Head variants now drop themselves when broken
    - Fixed crash when piglin brute drops a Buckler
- Many internal code improvements
